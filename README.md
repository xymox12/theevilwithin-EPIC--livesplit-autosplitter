# The Evil Within (EPIC) LiveSplit Autosplitter and Layout

A basic autosplitter for the EPIC Store version of The Evil Within. There are not guarantees that this will work for everyone as it has only been tested on my system. 

You will need import the autosplitter script via the Layout Editor >> Scriptable Auto Splitter module, and enter the 15 Segement (Chapter) names via the Splits Editor.  If you now start timer it should follow the ingame time. If the timer doesn't start or is showing real time, it probably means the pointers are not correct for your version of the game.

FYI - you don't need to use the layout provided.
